Butterfly effect
Go for a contrast image between a small easy game and an out-of-control result

* 

You're a butterfly driving for Domino Pizza. Your entire goal is to get from point A to point B. 
There's a small city grid system with a randomized start and end point somewhere on the edges. The only instructions are to get to point B within 10 seconds. 
Then level 2 is the same thing, same grid, and you can see your previous car at the same starting point. Timer starts, you start moving, and now you have to dodge your last run as well.
Level 3 starts again, random route, dodging another run. 




Plan game mechanics
Pseudocode, plan the game structure (let's just do pygame?)
Implement the code, MVP
Test, tighten up controls and fun stuff
Do a QOL pass, menu, ui, etc.
Make it feel a bit better, sfx, juice
Art pass? 
Any stretch goals?
Compile, debug, etc.
Submit, upload art and marketing stuff
