Naming conventions:

files:
Different titles starting with the broadest identifier moving towards the most specific. This is to help with sorting and searching the files.
no spaces, subtitiles are separated by _ underscores and words in the subtitles are separated by - dashes

example:
L_t1_collision-map_1.png

L -> Level, first title to designate the broadest identifier
t1 -> 2nd title, describing L. 2nd broadest identifier
collision-map -> 3rd title, most specific identifier. This is a collison map for Level t1
1 -> identifier to differentiate different versions of this file, only used if there are multiple necessary versions. Consider giving the different versions their own descriptors instead.


variables:
CONSTANT_VARIABLES are always capitalized and defined at the top of the file.

standard_variables
all lowercase, use _underscores for spaces.
If they are used in more than one function, avoid over-abreviation.
If they are strictly local variables only used in some function, this is less important.


functions:
typically CamelCase() as well, unless built-in function like __init__()

class:
CamelCase(), always capitalized

Butterfly effect
Go for a contrast image between a small easy game and an out-of-control result

* 

You're a butterfly driving for Domino Pizza. Your entire goal is to get from point A to point B. 
There's a small city grid system with a randomized start and end point somewhere on the edges. The only instructions are to get to point B within 10 seconds. 
Then level 2 is the same thing, same grid, and you can see your previous car at the same starting point. Timer starts, you start moving, and now you have to dodge your last run as well.
Level 3 starts again, random route, dodging another run. 




Plan game mechanics
Pseudocode, plan the game structure (let's just do pygame?)
Implement the code, MVP
Test, tighten up controls and fun stuff
Do a QOL pass, menu, ui, etc.
Make it feel a bit better, sfx, juice
Art pass? 
Any stretch goals?
Compile, debug, etc.
Submit, upload art and marketing stuff
