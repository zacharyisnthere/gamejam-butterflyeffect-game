<h4>What This Is and Future Goals</h4>
<p>This was a game made for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/cozy-spring-jam-2025'>Cozy Spring Jam 2025</a> to fit the theme "BUTTERFLY EFFECT."</p>
<p>The idea for the main mechanic was each time you deliver a pizza, you affect your future self's attempt to deliver their pizza. While I didn't have time to give the game a solid art pass originally, the response to the core mechanic was solid enough to justify a post-jam version, which is being worked on now.</p>
<p>All of the source code is here on this repo, if you'd like to you feel free to fork it and play around with it yourself however you want to. I'm a big fan of the FOSS school of thought, so this repo most likely isn't going anywhere even if a finished version of the game ever comes out. Just shoot me an email if you do, it's fun seeing something I made find someone who cares about it enough to fuck with it a bit.</p>
